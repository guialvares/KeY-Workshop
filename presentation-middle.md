## Defaults
- Different from Java, Solidity has no nulls <!-- .element: class="fragment fade-in-then-semi-out" -->
- Each variable is initialized with default values <!-- .element: class="fragment fade-in-then-semi-out" -->
- The main challenge is how to axiomatize the heap to get the defaults lazily just when reading from the heap <!-- .element: class="fragment fade-in" -->
