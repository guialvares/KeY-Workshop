## Memory and storage
- Storage holds data between function calls <!-- .element: class="fragment fade-in-then-semi-out" -->
- Memory is a temporary place to store data <!-- .element: class="fragment  fade-in-then-semi-out" -->
- Memory in Solidity is similar to Java where each arrays and structs are like pointers. They are object identities <!-- .element: class="fragment fade-in-then-semi-out" -->
- In storage, array and structs have no identities. There is no alias. Every assignment is a deep copy <!-- .element: class="fragment fade-in-then-semi-out" -->
- In addition, there are storage path variables. It represents a path into a storage <!-- .element: class="fragment fade-in-then-semi-out" -->
