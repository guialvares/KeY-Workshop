## Memory and storage
- Storage holds data between function calls
- Memory is a temporary place to store data
- Memory in Solidity is similar to Java where each arrays and structs are like pointers. They store identities
- In storage, each variable has its value. Every assignment is a deep copy
- In Solidity, there are storage path variables. It represents a path to a storage variable
